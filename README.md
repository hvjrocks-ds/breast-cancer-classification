# breast-cancer-classification
This repository contains the breast cancer dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) and my analysis and ML modeling code in it.
In this exercise I have used many ML algorithms to classify if the cancer is benign or malignant. 
In the end I have also provided my recommendation for which algorithm to use in a particular setting as the conclusion.
